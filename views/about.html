                    The Duquesne Incline is one of those which follows very 
                    closely the tracks of an early coal hoist. Old newspapers 
                    indicate the existence of such a conveyance as early as 1854. 
                    Residents apparently referred to it as "Kirk Lewis' incline" and 
                    located it on the present site of The Duquesne Incline's Upper Station. 
                    Grandview Avenue was then the High Street, and the area was just 
                    beginning to be converted from farmland to homesites. This            
                    pleasantly-situated acreage was an excellent area to absorb 
                    some of the expanding population of the city, but the problem 
                    of easy access was still to be solved. <span id = 'history-read-more' tabindex = '0'>Read More</span>

                    The incline was built in 1877 by Samuel Diescher, who had 
                    previously constructed the Monongahela Incline. The cars were 
                    designed by J. C. Inclined Plane Railway, which had also built 
                    the cars for the Monongahela Incline. The incline was closed 
                    for two years in the 1960s and reopened in 1963 when a group 
                    of local residents formed a non-profit corporation to purchase 
                    and restore the incline. The incline has since been totally 
                    refurbished and is now a major tourist attraction.
  
                    Although plans for a freight and passenger incline are known 
                    to have existed much earlier, financial backing was exceedingly 
                    hard to find--even the modest sum of $47,000--and actual 
                    construction was delayed. Eventually, of course, difficulties 
                    were overcome and the Incline was built. It was opened to the 
                    public May 20, 1877. The Duquesne Incline was the first Pittsburgh 
                    incline designed and built by Samuel Diescher, for Kirk Bigham 
                    and Associates. Mr. Diescher, an engineer, had become the country's 
                    foremost builder of inclines. He was also to design and build 
                    most of those that followed.
                    
                    At the time of its public opening, it was one of four inclined 
                    planes serving the summit of Coal Hill, which later came to be 
                    known as Mount Washington. The Duquesne Incline was operated, 
                    from 1877 until 1962 by The Duquesne Inclined Plane Company. 
                    From 1964 until the present, the Incline has been operated by 
                    the Society for the Preservation of The Duquesne Heights Incline; 
                    it has been owned by the Port Authority of Allegheny County.

                  The Society for the Preservation of the Duquesne Heights 
                  Incline was formed in 1964 by the Duquesne Heights/Mount 
                  Washington neighborhood group that had rescued, repaired, 
                  and reopened the Incline in 1963. The purpose was to continue 
                  to restore and rehabilitate the cars, equipment, and both 
                  stations, and to establish the entire operation as a reliable 
                  commuter facility and a popular visitor attraction.  Memberships 
                  in the society are available, call for details.
